## Kubernetes

### Core Concepts
- Cluster architecture and components
- Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets
- Services, Ingress, Network Policies
- ConfigMaps, Secrets management
- Persistent Volumes and storage classes
- Auto-scaling (HPA, VPA, Cluster Autoscaler)
- RBAC and security policies

### Advanced Topics
- Helm charts and package management
- Operators and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- Multi-cluster management
- Service mesh integration (Istio, Linkerd)
- GitOps with ArgoCD/Flux

### Production Best Practices
- Resource requests and limits
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Pod Disruption Budgets
- Network policies for security
- Pod security policies/standards
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Container Best Practices

### Docker Optimization
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage builds
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
USER node
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

- Minimize layer count
- Use .dockerignore effectively
- Run as non-root user
- Security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
- Image signing and verification

### Container Registry
- Harbor (self-hosted)
- ECR, ACR, GCR (cloud providers)
- Vulnerability scanning
- Image promotion pipelines
- Retention policies

## Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform
- Module design and reusability
- State management (S3, Terraform Cloud)
- Workspaces for environments
- Provider configuration
- Best practices for large infrastructures

**Example: AWS EKS Cluster**
```hcl
module "eks" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  version = "~> 19.0"

  cluster_name    = "my-cluster"
  cluster_version = "1.28"

  vpc_id     = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets

  eks_managed_node_groups = {
    general = {
      desired_size = 2
      min_size     = 1
      max_size     = 10

      instance_types = ["t3.medium"]
      capacity_type  = "ON_DEMAND"
    }
  }
}
```

### CloudFormation / ARM Templates
- Template design patterns
- Stack dependencies
- Change sets for safe updates
- Cross-stack references

## Cost Optimization

### Strategies
- Right-sizing instances based on metrics
- Reserved Instances and Savings Plans
- Spot Instances for non-critical workloads
- Auto-scaling to match demand
- S3 lifecycle policies (Glacier, Intelligent-Tiering)
- Database optimization (read replicas, caching)
- CDN for static content delivery
- Unused resource cleanup

### Monitoring Costs
- AWS Cost Explorer / Azure Cost Management / GCP Cost Management
- Budget alerts and anomaly detection
- Tagging strategies for cost allocation
- FinOps practices

## High Availability & Disaster Recovery

### Multi-AZ/Multi-Region
- Load balancer setup across zones
- Database replication strategies
- Cross-region failover
- Data synchronization

### Backup Strategies
- Automated snapshots
- Cross-region backup replication
- Retention policies
- Restore testing procedures

### RTO/RPO Planning
- Recovery Time Objective targets
- Recovery Point Objective requirements
- Failover runbooks
- Disaster recovery drills
