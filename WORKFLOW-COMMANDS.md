# Hybrid Workflow Commands Reference

This guide explains the hybrid slash commands that combine development workflow stages with technology expertise.

## Overview

Workflow commands provide **structured, guided development** through each stage of the software development lifecycle. Each command invokes the appropriate agents and provides checklists, best practices, and step-by-step guidance.

## Command Structure

```
/workflow-[stage]-[technology]
```

Examples:
- `/workflow-design-architecture` - General architecture design

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Feature Development
```bash
/workflow-design-nextjs              # Design the feature
/workflow-implement-fullstack        # Build it end-to-end
/workflow-review-code               # Review quality
/workflow-review-security           # Audit security
/workflow-qa-e2e                    # Write tests
/workflow-write-docs                # Document the feature
```

### Pattern 2: Frontend-Only Feature
```bash
/workflow-design-nextjs              # Design UI structure
/workflow-implement-frontend         # Build components
/workflow-review-code               # Review quality
/workflow-qa-e2e                    # Write tests
```

### Pattern 3: Backend API Development
```bash
/workflow-design-architecture        # Design API architecture
/workflow-implement-backend          # Build API
/workflow-review-code               # Review quality
/workflow-review-security           # Security audit
```

### Pattern 4: New Project Setup
```bash
/workflow-design-architecture        # System architecture
/workflow-design-nextjs             # Next.js structure
/workflow-implement-fullstack       # Build initial features
/workflow-review-code              # Review quality
/workflow-review-security          # Security audit
/workflow-review-performance       # Performance check

/workflow-write-docs               # Create comprehensive docs
/workflow-deploy                   # Deploy to production
```

### Pattern 5: Performance Optimization
```bash
/workflow-review-performance        # Identify issues
/workflow-implement-frontend        # Optimize UI (if needed)
/workflow-implement-backend         # Optimize queries (if needed)
/workflow-review-performance        # Verify improvements
```

### Pattern 6: Security Hardening
```bash
/workflow-review-security           # Audit current state
/workflow-implement-backend         # Fix backend issues
/workflow-implement-frontend        # Fix frontend issues
/workflow-review-security          # Re-audit
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Commands vs Direct Agent Invocation

**Use Workflow Commands When:**
- ‚úÖ You want structured, step-by-step guidance
- ‚úÖ You're new to a technology or pattern
- ‚úÖ You want comprehensive checklists
- ‚úÖ You're building a complete feature
- ‚úÖ You want to ensure nothing is missed

**Use Direct Agent Invocation When:**
- ‚úÖ You need quick, specific help
- ‚úÖ You know exactly what you need
- ‚úÖ You're experienced with the workflow
- ‚úÖ You're fixing a small issue
- ‚úÖ You're exploring or prototyping

### Command Sequencing

**‚úÖ Good Sequencing:**
```bash
/workflow-design-nextjs ‚Üí /workflow-implement-fullstack ‚Üí /workflow-review-code
```
(Design first, implement, then review)

**‚ùå Poor Sequencing:**
```bash
/workflow-implement-fullstack ‚Üí /workflow-design-nextjs
```
(Don't implement before designing)

### Iterative Development

Commands can be run multiple times:
```bash
/workflow-implement-frontend        # First iteration
/workflow-review-code              # Find issues
/workflow-implement-frontend        # Fix issues
/workflow-review-code              # Verify fixes
```

## Tips for Effective Usage

1. **Read the Checklist** - Each command provides a comprehensive checklist
2. **Follow the Time Estimates** - Budget appropriate time
3. **Use Multiple Review Commands** - Security, performance, and code quality are all important
4. **Run Tests After Implementation** - Use `/workflow-qa-e2e` after `/workflow-implement-*` commands
5. **Document as You Go** - Use agents to generate documentation during development
6. **Deploy Early and Often** - Use `/workflow-deploy` to set up CI/CD early

## Customization

You can create your own workflow commands by adding markdown files to `.claude/commands/`:

```markdown

See existing commands in `.claude/commands/` for examples.
